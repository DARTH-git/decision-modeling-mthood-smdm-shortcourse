# Mt Hood Diabetes Challenge/SMDM Short Course on Decision Modeling in R

Material for 2023’s [Mt Hood Diabetes Challenge/SMDM Short Course on
Decision Modeling in
R](https://www.mthooddiabeteschallenge.com/program-1)

In preparation for the workshop, participants should complete the
following steps:

1.  Download and install R (<https://www.r-project.org/>) and RStudio
    Desktop (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/>) if you do not
    already have them installed on your computer. Both of these
    resources are free.
2.  Download this repository as a .zip file and unzip it to a working
    directory (where they will complete the workshop exercises).
3.  Open the folders and double-click the RStudio projects “\*.Rproj”.
    This should open an Rstudio window with the working directory set to
    the participant materials folder.
4.  For the calibration material open the R script “00_prep.R” and run
    the script. This script installs the R packages necessary for the
    workshop. IMPORTANT: If you encounter errors when running the
    “00_prep.R” script, please attempt to resolve them based on the
    error messages provided (e.g. by installing or updating packages,
    checking permissions in the folder they are working in, updating
    their version of R or Rstudio, etc.). There will be a limited amount
    of time to resolve R software issues during the workshop.
